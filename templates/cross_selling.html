            Model Fit
    Pseudo R-squared: 0.203
    This indicates a moderate fit, suggesting that around 20% of the variation in customer disengagement is explained by the independent variables included in the model.
            
    AIC and BIC:
            
    AIC: 63.4383
            
    BIC: 82.4405
    These values help assess the goodness-of-fit for the model, with lower values indicating a better fit, although the model fit is not perfect.
            
    2. Significant Factors
    From the output, we can identify which factors have a significant influence on customer disengagement.
            
    Children: The coefficient is positive but has a high p-value (0.8332), meaning the presence of children does not significantly affect disengagement in this model.
            
    Age Range:
            
    Age Range 45-54: Coefficient is negative (-0.8134), but it is not statistically significant (p-value 0.4819).
            
    Age Range 55-64: Similarly, it is negative (-1.9320) but not significant (p-value 0.1307).
            
    Age Range 65-74: Negative (-2.0615), but not significant (p-value 0.2175).
            
    Age Range 75+: Positive (0.6904), but not significant (p-value 0.6813).
            
    Income Range:
            
    Income Range 150K+: Extremely high coefficient (21.7562), but the p-value is nearly 1 (0.9997), suggesting that this coefficient is not practically useful.
            
    Income Range 35-49K: Positive coefficient (0.4779), but not significant (p-value 0.7000).
            
    Income Range 50-74K: Negative coefficient (-1.3347), not significant (p-value 0.2651).
            
    Income Range 75-99K: Positive coefficient (1.5420), not significant (p-value 0.3168).
            
    Income Range Under 35K: Positive coefficient (1.4318), but not significant (p-value 0.3601).
            
    Household Composition (1 Adult and Kids): The coefficient is very small (-0.0542) and not significant (p-value 0.9558), indicating that this factor doesn't significantly influence disengagement.
            
    Predicting Customer Disengagement
    Risk of Disengagement:
    Age: Based on the age ranges, older customers (age 65 and above) might be at a higher risk of disengagement as they show a higher negative coefficient, but none of the age categories are statistically significant.
            
    Income: Customers with lower income ranges (under 35K) might be more prone to disengagement, as this group has a positive coefficient, although it isn't statistically significant.
            
    Household Composition: The lack of significance for household composition (1 Adult and Kids) suggests that this factor doesn't directly affect disengagement.
            
    Key Retention Strategies:
    To address disengagement, here are some strategies that could be derived from the model:
            
    Targeting Older Demographics: While age is not statistically significant, older customers may still be more likely to disengage. Offering special benefits or discounts for seniors could be a helpful retention strategy.
            
    Focus on Lower Income Groups: Although the income groups did not show statistical significance, there may still be an opportunity to target lower-income customers (Under 35K) with more personalized, affordable offers to prevent disengagement.
            
    Customer Segmentation: Since certain income groups show signs of disengagement, personalized engagement campaigns based on income could be created. For instance, customers from higher-income brackets could be offered premium loyalty programs or special services.
            
    Engagement Programs for Families: Since household composition did not significantly affect disengagement, creating family-focused programs or perks (e.g., family discounts, kids' entertainment) may encourage ongoing engagement.

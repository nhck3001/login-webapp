    <h1>Customer Disengagement Analysis</h1>
    <p>
        This analysis identifies non-loyal households at risk of disengagement by detecting decreasing spending trends over time.
        The bar chart below shows disengagement rates by age group, and the regression summary outlines which household characteristics
        most significantly correlate with disengagement.

            Based on the logistic regression analysis, several factors influence the likelihood of customer disengagement. The age range appears to have a mild effect, with older customers (aged 65 and above) showing a slightly higher risk of disengagement, although this factor is not statistically significant. Income is another key factor, with lower-income customers (under 35K) potentially at a higher risk of disengagement, although this is also not statistically significant. Household composition, specifically households with one adult and kids, did not show a significant effect on disengagement. Retention strategies should focus on targeting older demographics with personalized benefits or discounts aimed at seniors, offering affordable solutions for lower-income customers, and creating family-focused programs or perks, as household composition didnâ€™t seem to impact disengagement. Additionally, customer segmentation based on income could help tailor specific engagement campaigns, such as premium services for higher-income customers or affordable offers for those at risk. While the model's results are not highly significant, these strategies could help prevent disengagement and foster continued customer engagement.
